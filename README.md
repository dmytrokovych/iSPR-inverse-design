## General info
Optimisation of internal Smith-Purcell radiation using inverse design method. Here is just a small part of the notebooks I created during my master's project.  

Frequency domain simulations of the radiation generated by a single electron moving parallel to
a periodic silicon structure and a silicon structure on a silica substrate have been performed. The
shape of the above structures was optimised for the intensity of the generated radiation. A direct
design method and a cutting-edge inverse design method were used for the optimisation. Inverse
design allows us to explore a much larger parameter space and obtain structures inaccessible to
human intuition. Optimised dielectric structures can be used to develop non-invasive electron beam
detectors.

Relative dielectric permeability $\varepsilon_r(x, y)$ and field $H_z(x, y)$ for four periods of optimal silicon gratings obtained by inverse design. Simulation of the $H_z$ field at a frequency of $\nu = 424 \mathrm{THz}$:\
